			\subsubsection{Fall}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - Looked over the email sent by Max to the client for "Winter is coming" project and then looked through and filled out the project selections. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} -  We were selected for the winter is coming project. We met after class to figure out a good meeting time that we could set up a schedule for meeting as well as figure out when we would like meet with victor to set up requirements for this project. After the email exchange happened we figured out  a time to meet and had our meeting. We asked him questions about the whole project about what expectations. After the meeting we met to discuss when we were free to work on the project. 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Finished the problem statement and turned it into teach.  Created and added group mates to the GitHub. Had meeting with TA. Went well. Asked some questions. Added Everyone to the GitHub and shared my One Note with the TA.
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Met with our group to compile the final draft of our problem statement.  Email was sent to victor to have him check the problem statement.  I drafted an email to our client and then sent it to him. He responded with a few changes he would like made. We made those changes and submitted the it to our groups one note.  Looked research that has been done by Travis and talked to our group about those notes. Formatted the Latex for requirements document and pushed it to the Git Hub.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Met with our group several times to talk about the requirements. Came up with the team name PlanteR-GB. We emailed victor to set up a meeting to discuss our requirements document. We had a meeting to disusse it and gave victor our current rough draft.  We made a few formatting changes and turned in the rough draft. 
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - Finished the requirements document and emailed victor and had him approve it. Had a meeting with junki to talk about technology document. We as a group figured out who is going to go over which technology.  Below are what each person is going to go over.  
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - Worked on the requirements documents. Met with the team to discuss which parts each of us were going to take. Did research on my parts, Mobile options, temperature and moisture sensor options, and web hosting options.  Met with the TA to discuss this as well.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Worked on tech review. Finished research  for it. Had a meeting with our TA and asked some questions. Zach worked on a logo so we now have a logo.  Going to start working on the final draft for Tuesday.  
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - Worked on finishing my final draft of my technology review document. Finished and turned in my technology review document.  
					\item \textbf{Week 10} - Finished the design doc an had a meeting with victor to discuss it and the materials needed for the project next term. 
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Winter}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - Met to discuss how our breaks went. We talked about the current state of the project.
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - Met and discussed the current state of the project and assigned each person a part of the project.  Travis was able to get LED's that we had on hand and a Teensy we had to Light up LED's 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Had a meeting to talk about the current state of the project, What needs to be done when, talked about the things that need to be done by each person and how it should be completed. Set up a scheduled meeting to work together each week. We got the hardware from victor and started working with it. Still missing a raspberry pie as the master controller.  
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Started to add the HTTP requests that are needed to communicate with the API for the command line interface. The framework that I was going to use for this C++ Requests turns out to be very difficult to add to a project if we do not want to clone the whole project and we would have to compile it every time. This makes it very cumbersome and would take a lot longer to compile. Looking at the alternatives it looks like it will be very difficult and time consuming to implement it in c++. We are looking at possible alternatives for this. Python requests is a good alternative and would make implementing it much simper.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Changed the script to python and worked with Zach about how to use the API appropriate.  Figured out how to use Python Request.
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - We were able to get an alpha up and working. We finished our progress report, EXPO poster, Progress Video.
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - Critical TODO: CLI - Finish soon (Austin), Multi-zone - FINISHED, Multi-controller - State composer Serializer sends EN pin, each nano checks pin for EN, Data parser - mostly written (needs relationships, insertion), Web interface - Started (uses mustache for templating, Apache 
											\\ Non-critical: State composer - checks state every 5-30 seconds rather than constantly, power - powered off separate supply (off the pi for now?) 
											\\ What is everyone working on: Austin - CLI/Site, Travis - Site, Zach - Data parser, Max - Multi controller communication 
											\\We all worked on our own part of that are described above. I worked on the script and was able to implement the controller section of the script.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Had Group Meeting Discussed the state of the project that was discussed in the last meeting. Everyone is working on their assigned part of the project. Today's meeting was more of a work meeting where everyone was working on their own part.  
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - We were able to get I2C working for communication across multiple controllers.  Talked about all the different states of the project. Talked about the site and how the plan to use mustache as a templating engine with apache is most likely not going to work since the documentation is out dated and is not clear. We are talking about using Node JS since Travis and I have experience with node and would make the development of the site easier and more stable. Going to continue researching to see if it will be viable on the pi zero.  
					\item \textbf{Week 10} -  Finished the script. Most of the site is setup and interacting with the internal state through the API using node js handlebars and express. We are very close to having a beta.  
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Spring}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - We discussed over slack a time to meet for the term and basic things we would like to discussed what needs to be covered in the first meeting.   
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - We had group meeting on Tuesday and Saturday to discuss the current state of the project. Discussed what each person needs to do for this term. What testing needs to be done as well as what features we would like to be done.  
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Had team meeting Tuesday and Saturday to discuss current state of the project. Worked on the poster.  
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Had team meeting on Tuesday and Saturday to discuss more site additions for adding more color.  Worked on poster. Filled in all information that was missing.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Worked on the color picker for the led states page. Was able to get it to output of the color picker to input the rgb values into the correct field. Will still need to add pallet for pre-defined colors and an alpha. That will hopefully be able to get it done before the 11th. We worked on and finished the poster. We submitted it and should be at expo on time.  
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - We met on Tuesday to discuss what was needed for Expo and get everything ready we figured what we needed and who was going to bring what as a backup in case we need something or something was not going to supplied.  We had our friend George 3d model a box that we can hold everything in and display during expo. I 3d Printed it on my 3d printer.  
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - We had Expo this week. It went well. We met to make sure that we had everything working. We had the box built by max's dad built. We made sure that we were able to make the full release  and fixed some bugs when it came to it not able to connect to the internet. We were able to make the full system and created several different profiles to display the different aspects of the system as we explained it. We had some acrylic cut for the top of our box so people could see the hardware required for our system to run. We decide that we did not need to meet during our normal scheduled meeting for Saturday.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Met on Tuesday to discuss what was left to do for the term. We broke down the hardware for Expo and set up what we need to deliver to Victor. We started laying out what needs to be done for the final paper. We outlined who is going to do what and when for the final paper. We met on Saturday to work on the progress report and to work on the final project that will be used for the hand off to victor.

		\subsection{Zach Lerew}
			\subsubsection{Fall}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - This week was entirely spent looking through projects and performing setup tasks like configuring OneNote. Early in the week I went through the project list and sorted them by my interest. Next I wrote descriptions for my top five choices. I contacted the client of my first choice to determine if they were open to additional goals and to get more information about the project. This week was primarily spent configuring software and absorbing information. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - During this week, I started with no knowledge of my project, team, or client. After the week has finished, I have met my team, established communication channels and organized the project and its files. My team has met with our client and gone over a series of questions to help establish our project and its goals. Next week we will be meeting with our TA, turning in rough drafts for problem statements, and building requirements for this project. 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Most of this week was an interlude between the Problem Statement and Requirements document. Our team has been in regular contact however, and I have been making final touches to the problem statement before the final draft is due. The team also met with our TA to discuss the project and the TA's role in it. 
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - This week we have finished planning and describing the 10,000 foot view of our project, the problem statement. We have contacted our client with the final draft and have received approval. There were a couple minor changes our client wanted to make, which have been done. 
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - This week our team has been focusing solely on the requirements document. We have had a couple meetings both in person and remotely to hash out the ideas we want in our document. We are fairly confident in the work we have done, and are on track to have our requirements document flushed out and finalized for version 1.0. We have met as a team several times, as well as with our client. We have been forming the image of where the project is heading and in what order, which is quite exciting to see this idea being formed into official documents. 
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - This week was spent doing a lot of brainstorming to transform our rough draft of the requirements document into a final draft. Last week we got the majority of our requirements done, and this week all we had left was a series of revisions, the Gantt chart, the bibliography, and minor changes to the latex formatting. We have also met as a team to discuss the direction we are headed for our technology review. 
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - This week was hectic. So far our team has had many thought streams flowing around in every direction, and we've been writing down different ideas we have for every part of the system. This week we are gently squeezing these thought streams into a coherent set of ideas. The process is difficult, but very necessary to produce a product. Our team is communicating frequently which makes this process easier. My efforts have been particularly stretched thin this week, as I lost both Friday and Saturday due to moving 
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - This week has been a lighter week compared to previous ones, I believe this is mostly due to the fact that I under estimated the time I would have to complete the technology review, and ended up producing what was essentially a final draft when the rough draft was due. I am glad that I did however, as I now have even more time to shape up my document. This is important because the sections I have are a deep part of the system, and will affect the core of the project. As for the issue suspected last week - we are a team of four, and as such there should be 12 individual pieces for our technology reviews. Our project is by no means small or simple, but we do not believe that there are 12 crucial categories of technology to discuss. The result of this is that some members of our team have spent their team researching less important tech that is relegated to stretch goals. This is not a bad thing, but something that we will need to keep in mind as the design document is being developed. 
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - This week, my team built an outline for the design document based on several examples found online, as well as the IEEE standard itself. Once the outline was completed and discussed, we individually began writing our components. Unfortunately we were unable to write enough content to build a rough draft for review. I also created a system diagram with individually labeled pieces. The system diagram has individual pieces, each of which will likely need its own diagram. I have also created the system diagram for the internal state, as well as part of the database. The last thing I did was some research into third party libraries for a REST client. 
					\item \textbf{Week 10} - This week our team took the individual technology review documents and merged each of the selected technologies as well as a series of diagrams and extra writing into a grand document called the design document. The design document is the overall how of the system, and should ideally allow a developer to build a system that matches the requirements with only slight deviation from the system we will be building. The final project this term is a progress report, but I fear that we do not have enough content to speak about, nor enough time to create 40 minutes of content. The vast majority of the work done this term was writing papers and designing the system. There is plenty to discuss of that nature, but I fear there may not be 40 minutes of content given our larger team. 
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Winter}
			\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - This first week was fairly successful but there is still a lot of work left to do for iteration 1. The internal state classes which represent all of the data in the system are put together and have been merged into the master branch. Internal state behavior has been started but has a long way to go as the project progresses. The behavior consists of things like adding/removing an LED to a zone, modifying a weekly schedule, or determining which LED state should be used based on the current time. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - The Internal State has primary objects in it, and together they make up the entirety of the system. Four of those objects are unique, and three of them are relational objects which tie the other four models together. The API performs the basic CRUD operations and queries the internal state based on user input or input from other parts of the software, so it has to be robust. I did not fully anticipate how much work would be involved in creating it however. There are 41 routes defined (a route being a unique URL which can be accessed in order to send data back and forth), and each one of those needs a function which modifies some aspect of the system's data. This week I created those routes and defined what all of the 41 action functions will be called, but I still have a lot of work to do in order to write each action. This code needs to be robust, because all system data goes through it. 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - This week our team had our first long meeting, we discussed how the API will work, looked at the hardware we've received from our client (so far), and wrote some algorithms for the LED Control system and flow diagrams for the command line interface. We have established a communication chain for who needs to talk to who about what. So far we have the LED controller (Teensy/arduino nano) controlling a strip of lights successfully, we have an internal state which holds all system data, an API which can take incoming requests and change/retrieve system data properly (formatted in JSON), and we have the beginning of a command line menu started, as well as the steps necessary for the LED control system. 
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - I have gotten the data parser up and running, and have built most of the basic constructs of the schema using the sqlite\_orm. I have run into a foreign key problem while developing the schema, but I have a potential solution that I will try next week. Hopefully it works and I can finish up the schema and start writing the query functions for insert, update, get, and delete. After that I can begin to integrate the DataParser into the API when data changes are made. 
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - The DataParser is my class implementation of an ORM (object relational manager). Essentially it provides a nice interface between my C++ objects and SQL code. This week I was able to get the schema fully created, including one-to-many relationships and many-to-many relationships as seen below. The system can now build a schema on initialization, create the sqlite db file, and insert data into it. I have a minimum working example for profiles which allows me to insert data and then load it when the system starts, but there is still a lot of work to do in order to complete the DataParser. Much like the API a couple weeks ago, I am now over most of the major issues, but I still have a lot of grunt work to do. 
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - So far this term, each part of the system has been developed and tested independently. Due to our extensive design last term, we are fairly confident in each of the pieces, but demonstrating that a command can be sent from the user interface all the way to the LED strip is a very important part of the process. I am slightly disappointed that we were not able to get this test done more than 1 day before the ALPHA presentation was due, because we would have had more time to debug and improve the quality of our ALPHA build. This week we have also tried to communicate with our client twice by email, and gotten no response either time. We are now approaching week 7 and we still have not received half of the hardware which we requested during winter break last year. Since then we have each been using our own hardware, and I personally have purchased my own raspberry pi zero w so that I can continue working on the project on an isolated system that matches the hardware we agreed upon during Fall term.  
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - Data parser work continues, but due to other classes and family visiting, I have not completed the data parser this week as I had planned. I am continuing work on it next week. Our team has had a meeting and discussed exactly what we need to do until the end of the term, so we are in fairly good shape to get those things done. 
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - The finishing steps of the dataParser were the hardest, because the system has so many small moving pieces that all have to work together. When a foreign key reference does not work on the database, the entire system crashes, so it is crucial that I keep the data in check and prevent the system from reaching a bad state. I believe I have finally accomplished that, and have asked my team to help me stress test it. 
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - Project is in decent shape, client meeting and demo went well, but we are still lacking a completely functioning CLI, and multi-controller support is going to need a lot of work despite our team starting the task 2 weeks earlier. MC support was not fully tested until this week when I dug into it. Our project is very close to beta status and meeting our performance metrics, but it would be better if the margin was larger. 
					\item \textbf{Week 10} - We are very close to being done, but the interface stuff got dragged out too long and won't be as polished anymore due to that. I did some last minute changes to add logging to files rather than std::cout, and cleaned up a lot of the code through the system. This weekend I am starting to help out with the Site to get everything finished up and in a BETA quality.ot of code all over the place. 
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Spring}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - Our schedules are pretty tight this term, but at least our project is in pretty good shape and ready for testing, bugfixing, and polish. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - Data parser has unit tests to cover insert, update, delete, and loading (select). I have also restructured the tests and fixed a couple bugs that were uncovered because of the data parser testing. Mostly they were default values that should have been set, or a minor re-organization to cover an edge case. The data parser feels complete to me at this point, and I am ready to start moving on to finishing the setup script (it needs rewritten), and working on a 3d printable enclosure for the system. Oh, and the silly wired article is done. It was a waste of time. 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - As of now, all of the systems have some form of unit testing. The Site and API are only partially tested, but they are being worked on still. The biggest remaining bug with the state composer appears to have been solved, and the team is adding polish here and there. Additionally, I have successfully completed the Setup scripts. This means that a user can go to the latest release of the system ( https://github.com/CarvellWakeman/plantergb/releases/tag/Latest), download a setup config file (setup.xml), Open it and flash it with PiBakery, insert that SD card into a Pi, and have a system up and running after about 20 minutes. This is primarily for our client should he ever want to update the system, but also so that the control service and website start when the Pi boots. Everything is starting to come together and it's looking pretty damn cool. 
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Finished the poster, got approved. Rewrote setup script and cleaned up the process for building a release. Added script to reconnect to wifi if signal is dropped. 
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Our team is on a great track for being done by the time expo comes around. 
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - The only remaining issue has existed since the beginning of spring term. The LEDs still blip to the wrong color in some circumstances which are hard to measure. Max seems to think it is a hardware problem at this point. 
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - I did one last change this week, where I added two command line parameters - one to use the LED simulator instead of serial, and the other added a maximum brightness cap to avoid over volting our hardware. 
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Finish up final report, build system for client, try to contact client for hand off. Started working on report by copying files from other projects and adding structure to the assignment. Team worked on oneNote summaries, organized what we need to make the client's system next week. 
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - The progress report is coming along nicely. It's very long, over 50 pages. This document should be done by this week, and we can start on the presentation.  
					\item \textbf{Week 10} - The progress report is done and polished, the presentation is outlined, and we are scheduled to meet with our client and hand off the client.
