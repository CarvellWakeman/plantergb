			\subsubsection{Fall}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - Looked over the email sent by Max to the client for "Winter is coming" project and then looked through and filled out the project selections. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} -  We were selected for the winter is coming project. We met after class to figure out a good meeting time that we could set up a schedule for meeting as well as figure out when we would like meet with victor to set up requirements for this project. After the email exchange happened we figured out  a time to meet and had our meeting. We asked him questions about the whole project about what expectations. After the meeting we met to discuss when we were free to work on the project. 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Finished the problem statement and turned it into teach.  Created and added group mates to the GitHub. Had meeting with TA. Went well. Asked some questions. Added Everyone to the GitHub and shared my One Note with the TA.
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Met with our group to compile the final draft of our problem statement.  Email was sent to victor to have him check the problem statement.  I drafted an email to our client and then sent it to him. He responded with a few changes he would like made. We made those changes and submitted the it to our groups one note.  Looked research that has been done by Travis and talked to our group about those notes. Formatted the Latex for requirements document and pushed it to the Git Hub.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Met with our group several times to talk about the requirements. Came up with the team name PlanteR-GB. We emailed victor to set up a meeting to discuss our requirements document. We had a meeting to disusse it and gave victor our current rough draft.  We made a few formatting changes and turned in the rough draft. 
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - Finished the requirements document and emailed victor and had him approve it. Had a meeting with junki to talk about technology document. We as a group figured out who is going to go over which technology.  Below are what each person is going to go over.  
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - Worked on the requirements documents. Met with the team to discuss which parts each of us were going to take. Did research on my parts, Mobile options, temperature and moisture sensor options, and web hosting options.  Met with the TA to discuss this as well.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Worked on tech review. Finished research  for it. Had a meeting with our TA and asked some questions. Zach worked on a logo so we now have a logo.  Going to start working on the final draft for Tuesday.  
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - Worked on finishing my final draft of my technology review document. Finished and turned in my technology review document.  
					\item \textbf{Week 10} - Finished the design doc an had a meeting with victor to discuss it and the materials needed for the project next term. 
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Winter}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - Met to discuss how our breaks went. We talked about the current state of the project.
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - Met and discussed the current state of the project and assigned each person a part of the project.  Travis was able to get LED's that we had on hand and a Teensy we had to Light up LED's 
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Had a meeting to talk about the current state of the project, What needs to be done when, talked about the things that need to be done by each person and how it should be completed. Set up a scheduled meeting to work together each week. We got the hardware from victor and started working with it. Still missing a raspberry pie as the master controller.  
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Started to add the HTTP requests that are needed to communicate with the API for the command line interface. The framework that I was going to use for this C++ Requests turns out to be very difficult to add to a project if we do not want to clone the whole project and we would have to compile it every time. This makes it very cumbersome and would take a lot longer to compile. Looking at the alternatives it looks like it will be very difficult and time consuming to implement it in c++. We are looking at possible alternatives for this. Python requests is a good alternative and would make implementing it much simper.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Changed the script to python and worked with Zach about how to use the API appropriate.  Figured out how to use Python Request.
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - We were able to get an alpha up and working. We finished our progress report, EXPO poster, Progress Video.
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - Critical TODO: CLI - Finish soon (Austin), Multi-zone - FINISHED, Multi-controller - State composer Serializer sends EN pin, each nano checks pin for EN, Data parser - mostly written (needs relationships, insertion), Web interface - Started (uses mustache for templating, Apache 
											\\ Non-critical: State composer - checks state every 5-30 seconds rather than constantly, power - powered off separate supply (off the pi for now?) 
											\\ What is everyone working on: Austin - CLI/Site, Travis - Site, Zach - Data parser, Max - Multi controller communication 
											\\We all worked on our own part of that are described above. I worked on the script and was able to implement the controller section of the script.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Had Group Meeting Discussed the state of the project that was discussed in the last meeting. Everyone is working on their assigned part of the project. Today's meeting was more of a work meeting where everyone was working on their own part.  
					\item \textbf{Week 9} - We were able to get I2C working for communication across multiple controllers.  Talked about all the different states of the project. Talked about the site and how the plan to use mustache as a templating engine with apache is most likely not going to work since the documentation is out dated and is not clear. We are talking about using Node JS since Travis and I have experience with node and would make the development of the site easier and more stable. Going to continue researching to see if it will be viable on the pi zero.  
					\item \textbf{Week 10} -  Finished the script. Most of the site is setup and interacting with the internal state through the API using node js handlebars and express. We are very close to having a beta.  
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection{Spring}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - We discussed over slack a time to meet for the term and basic things we would like to discussed what needs to be covered in the first meeting.   
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - We had group meeting on Tuesday and Saturday to discuss the current state of the project. Discussed what each person needs to do for this term. What testing needs to be done as well as what features we would like to be done.  
					\item \textbf{Week 3} - Had team meeting Tuesday and Saturday to discuss current state of the project. Worked on the poster.  
					\item \textbf{Week 4} - Had team meeting on Tuesday and Saturday to discuss more site additions for adding more color.  Worked on poster. Filled in all information that was missing.  
					\item \textbf{Week 5} - Worked on the color picker for the led states page. Was able to get it to output of the color picker to input the rgb values into the correct field. Will still need to add pallet for pre-defined colors and an alpha. That will hopefully be able to get it done before the 11th. We worked on and finished the poster. We submitted it and should be at expo on time.  
					\item \textbf{Week 6} - We met on Tuesday to discuss what was needed for Expo and get everything ready we figured what we needed and who was going to bring what as a backup in case we need something or something was not going to supplied.  We had our friend George 3d model a box that we can hold everything in and display during expo. I 3d Printed it on my 3d printer.  
					\item \textbf{Week 7} - We had Expo this week. It went well. We met to make sure that we had everything working. We had the box built by max's dad built. We made sure that we were able to make the full release  and fixed some bugs when it came to it not able to connect to the internet. We were able to make the full system and created several different profiles to display the different aspects of the system as we explained it. We had some acrylic cut for the top of our box so people could see the hardware required for our system to run. We decide that we did not need to meet during our normal scheduled meeting for Saturday.  
					\item \textbf{Week 8} - Met on Tuesday to discuss what was left to do for the term. We broke down the hardware for Expo and set up what we need to deliver to Victor. We started laying out what needs to be done for the final paper. We outlined who is going to do what and when for the final paper. We met on Saturday to work on the progress report and to work on the final project that will be used for the hand off to victor.

			\subsubsection{Fall}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textbf{Week 1} - This week was entirely spent looking through projects and performing setup tasks like configuring OneNote. Early in the week I went through the project list and sorted them by my interest. Next I wrote descriptions for my top five choices. I contacted the client of my first choice to determine if they were open to additional goals and to get more information about the project. This week was primarily spent configuring software and absorbing information. 
					\item \textbf{Week 2} - During this week, I started with no knowledge of my project, team, or client. After the week has finished, I have met my team, established communication channels and organized the project and its files. My team has met with our client and gone over a series of questions to help establish our project and its goals. Next week we will be meeting with our TA, turning in rough drafts for problem statements, and building requirements for this project.
